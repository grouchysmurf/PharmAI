Analyze medication profiles using machine learning

This project has been adapted from [medorder_prediction](https://github.com/grouchysmurf/medorder_prediction) to perform retrospective analysis of medication profiles instead of predicting each oncoming order. It also includes all the code required to do this prospectively as in medorder_prediction.

The work currently under way in this repo aims to merge prospective and retrospective analysis in a single repo.
